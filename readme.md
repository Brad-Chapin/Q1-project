Ship, Captain, and Crew is a simple game of chance for two players. Gameplay progresses over 5 turns of 3 rounds each, wherein each player throws 5 dice. The goal is to accumulate a Ship (a six), a Captain (a five), and a Crew (a four), at which point the remaining two dice are totaled, and added to the player's cumulative game score. If a player acquires their Ship, Captain, and Crew before their last toss of the dice, they may throw the last two dice again in an attempt to get a higher score, but they do so at their peril: whatever the new toss is stands, even if it's lower.

Ship, Captain, and Crew was created using HTML5, CSS3, and the Materialize framework for the presentation and user interface, javascript and jQuery for the logic and game mechanics, and an API call to create the "talk like a pirate" feature.
